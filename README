libmtexp is a library that provides an intuitive interface to OpenGL
multitexturing.
See documentation under the doc directory for more information on how to use it.

- Compiling
To build libmtexp as a shared library just type `make' (without the quotes
obviously). If you wish to build a static library instead, type `make
libmtexp.a'.
You may also wish to change to the examples directory and compile the sample
program there by typing make.

- License
libmtexp is free software, released under the GNU General Public License. See
COPYING at the root directory of the library for more details.
