libmtexp is a library that provides an intuitive interface to OpenGL
multitexturing.
See documentation under the doc directory for more information on how to use it.

- Compiling on UNIX
To build libmtexp as a shared library just type `make' (without the quotes
obviously). If you wish to build a static library instead, type `make
libmtexp.a'.
Then you may type `make install' as root, to install the library. To change the
installation prefix, edit the first line of the Makefile, the default is
/usr/local.
You may also wish to change to the examples directory and compile the sample
program there by typing make.

- Compiling on Windows
You can only build libmtexp as a static library under windows. You must have MS
Visual Studio.NET 2003 or later installed. Open the included mtexp.sln solution
which contains two projects, the library and the example, and compile them from
there.
No installation procedure on windows, just add the src/ subdirectory of mtexp to
the include path of your program that uses mtexp, and link with the static
library which should be at the Release or Debug directories under mtexp when you
build it.

- License
libmtexp is free software, released under the GNU General Public License. See
COPYING at the root directory of the library for more details.
